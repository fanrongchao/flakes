  trigger: task requires temporary tool/runtime not already present
  decision: prefer nix shell or nix run over global install
  rule: use Nix-provided ephemeral environment first
  evidence:
    - repository is NixOS-focused flake workflow
    - reproducibility and rollback safety are primary goals
  risk: medium
  auto_apply: true
  confidence: high
  ask_when:
    - tool is unavailable in nixpkgs/flake inputs
    - user explicitly requires non-Nix install path
  fallback: provide explicit non-Nix path with rationale and cleanup plan

  decision: treat as cross-host impact by default
  rule: enumerate potentially impacted hosts before execution
  evidence:
    - hosts import shared profiles heavily
  risk: medium

  confidence: high
  ask_when:
    - changed profile is proven single-host only
  fallback: run conservative host-impact list using imports and ask for final target set
